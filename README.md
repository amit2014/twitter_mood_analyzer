Coding project for Mevoked

**Prompt:**
Iidentify worrisome patterns for an individual user on Twitter. Take 100+ Tweets (randomized data set, size can be defined by you based on what confidence interval you may want to show), run it through your tool (for our exercise focus on negative vs positive text), and show how these graph (to be defined by you). Build a simple alert system (can be built into the graph) that highlights the worrisome trends. I will let you define the patterns and structure you want to present.
